You are using a proportion of Invariable sites estimate, although I don't
like it. The likelihood epsilon "-f e" will be automatically lowered to 0.001
to avoid unfavorable effects caused by simultaneous optimization of alpha and P-Invar


Using BFGS method to optimize GTR rate parameters, to disable this specify "--no-bfgs"

Alignment has 24992 distinct alignment patterns

Found 0 invariant alignment patterns that correspond to 0 columns 
Proportion of gaps and completely undetermined characters in this alignment: 31.44%

RAxML rapid hill-climbing mode

Using 1 distinct models/data partitions with joint branch length optimization


Executing 1 inferences on the original alignment using 1 distinct randomized MP trees

All free model parameters will be estimated by RAxML
ML estimate of 25 per site rate categories

Likelihood of final tree will be evaluated and optimized under GAMMA+P-Invar

GAMMA+P-Invar Model parameters will be estimated up to an accuracy of 0.0010000000 Log Likelihood units
